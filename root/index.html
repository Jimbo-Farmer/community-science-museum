            <h1>welcome</h1>
            <p>to your Community Science Museum where we’re committed to making science accessible to all.</p>
            <p>Over the course of human history, science has developed from our early understanding of fire, wind, water, and earth to exploring everything from galaxies far away to the very building blocks of life itself.</p> 
            <p>Many of our exhibits are designed for you to interact with and play around to see science come to life (apart from the dinosaur exhibits – they only come to life at night when everyone’s gone home).</p>

            <p>Come on down and learn about Newtonian physics from our <span>bumper swing,</span> or why not travel back in time and meet our resident <span>Woolly Mammoth?</span> Our exhibits are designed to be accessible for interested minds, so make sure you come ready to learn and explore.
            </p>
            <p>We also have the <span>Young Stars club</span> which meets once a week on a Saturday between 10:00 and 13:00 where you’ll get to <span>explore and experiment</span> with our team of experts.</p>
            <p>During the school holidays we run special <span>holiday clubs</span> where you can join other children your age to go on a <span>journey of discovery.</span> Each holiday we pick a new theme to explore.
