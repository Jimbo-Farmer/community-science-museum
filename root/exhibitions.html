            <h2>ecology</h2>
            <p>As we learn more about the impact humans are having on the planet, the more important it becomes that scientists explore how to create a sustainable future not just for humans but for the whole planet.</p>

        <article class="info-text" id="evolution">
            <h2>evolution</h2>
            <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins. Where do we come from and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.</p>

            <h2>biology and medicine</h2>
            <p>From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique insights into the great wonders of the tiny world. For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much improved, thanks to the growth of our understanding of medicine.

            </div>
            <p>Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart transplant. </p>
            <p>Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from observing animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.</p>
